# Seismic
Seismic is a Log Parser for server logs of the game Quake 3 Arena. Make your data easy to read and manipulate exporting it to JSON or pretty-printing it to the terminal!

## Installation
```
$ git clone https://github.com/elimarp/seismic.git
$ cd seismic
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```
Now that you've downloaded the project and it's dependencies and built it, you're good to go!

## Usage
Seismic has an interactive CLI so you don't have to bother writing long commands. Try `npm start` or `node dist/src`  
![demo](https://s3.amazonaws.com/elimarp.github/SEISMIC.gif)  
The Interactive CLI first lists you the logs files available in `./gamelogs`, so you can either add you logs files to this folder or select `Use another file` to input any other path.

## Running Tests
You can run the unit tests in this project by running `npm test` in your terminal. You can also collect test coverage information with `npm run test:coverage`. A `test/coverage` folder will be generated by [Jest](https://github.com/jestjs/jest).

## Developer Notes
This project was Test-Driven Developed (TDD) following the Clean Architecture principles in order to maintain it's structure independent of frameworks, databases, and external dependencies of any kinds.
